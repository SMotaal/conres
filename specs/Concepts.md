# ConRes Specifications
## Concepts

### **`1.` Test Suite**

> **Important Note**: The definitions below involve _opinionated stipulations_ for historically fuzzy terminology, which is largely open to interpretation and disagreement, especially in edge-cases dealing only with a limited subset of the defined concepts, subject to over-generalization, preferences and/or conventions.

#### **`1.a.` Logical**

<ul>

**`1.a.1.` Test Target** — A distinct set of one or more measurable features (ie image elements) intended for the systematic quantification of a specific process capability for certain operating conditions.

<ul>

**`1.a.1.a.` Supplementary Test Target(s)** — One or more operationally significant but logically distinct test targets meant for calibration and/or validation of the operating conditions.

</ul>

**`1.a.2.` Test Block** — A contiguous array (image area) containing a subset of measurable features, which may either be autonomously or practically divided depending on the testing requirements and constraints.

**`1.a.3.` Test Patch** — A distinct measurable feature (image element) with well-defined sampling criteria and aimpoints.

</ul>

#### **`1.b.` Operational**

<ul>

**`1.b.1.` Test Form** — an "imposed" sheet containing one or more test elements.

- From the producer side, test elements will usually be "arranged or imposed" according to the measurement and/or capture requirements, with clear instructions for handling by the operator, where it is important to clearly mark enclosing areas with test images, intended for reliable processing and sampling.

- From the operator side, sheets will usually be "labeled", "trimmed" and "collated" following instructions and marked enclosing areas.


Would it help to spcifically explain the difference between Test Form and Test Chart? I am still confused.


**`1.b.2.` Test Chart** — trimmed sheet(s) containing individual or sequential test area _normally_ intended for measurement by specialized equipment that often rely on track marks for alignment and positioning.

> **Note**: The special case when printing a single [_Test Target_](#test-target), where generally (but not strictly) the target is a single page, and irrespective of the intended measurement method, such a sheet may also be referred to as a chart in appropriate contexts where it is not ambiguous to any consumer(s).

<ul>

- From the operator side, charts will usually be "stored" using a data interchange format which will often involve quantitative measurements, reference data, and which (in most cases) will encompass measurements across the entire set of charts for the same [_Test Target_](#test-target).

- From the implementor side, an abstract `Asset` class `TestChart` would provide the capabilities to `encode`, `decode`, and `iterate` over measured data `structures` and/or `views`, and where it can also provide the `loadFrom…` (retrieved) and `saveTo…` (stored) operations for "measured" and/or "analyzed" charts.

**`1.b.2.a.` Test Chart Page** (for measurement) — a trimmed sheet containing a single sequentially identifiable, which is _normally_ applicable for test charts that extend beyond the limits of the output and/or scanning device(s), but also, in the right context, may apply to "page 1 of 1".

> **Note**: Redundancies which are not explicitly defined as sequentially ordered parts of the single respective [_Test Definition_](#test-definition) are not considered under this definition.

</ul>

**`1.b.3.` Test Leaf** — a trimmed sheet containing a single individually identifiable test area _normally_ intended for captured by an image scanner with explicit constraints and controls.

<ul>

- From the operator side, leafs will usually be "recorded" as a lossless bitmap image, but may would still involve straightening and/or cropping once "consumed" by the appropriate software implementation.

- From the implementor side, the abstract class `TestImage` would provide the capabilities to `optimize` (straightening and cropping), and `extract` (synthetic slicing), and where it can also provide the `loadFrom…` and `saveTo…` operations meant for "retrieving" and "recording" of scanned and/or optimized leafs.

**`1.b.3.a.` Test Slice** — synthetic segments of the "optimized" leaf directly associated with a particular _Test Block_ or _Test Patch_ (below).

> **Note**: The term "synthetic" here applies to operations that may be accomplished in virtual memory — ie without additional requirements for storage allocations of the respective content.

</ul>
</ul>
